* Note this is considered as progress indicator in design.

### Usage

Import
```js
import '@brightspace-ui/core/components/meter/meter-linear.js';
```

Then add the `d2l-meter-linear`, provide values for the properties, `value` and `max`.

```html
<d2l-meter-linear id="no-progress" value="0" max="10" text="Visited: {x/y}"></d2l-meter-linear>
<d2l-meter-linear id="has-progress" value="3" max="10" text="Activities" text-inline percent></d2l-meter-linear>
<d2l-meter-linear id="completed" value="10" max="10" text="{%} Activities"></d2l-meter-linear>
```

***Properties:***

* `value` (required): The current number of units that have been marked as completed. Should be a positive, non-zero number that is less than or equal to `max`
* `max` (required): Max number of units that is being measured by this meter. For results this should be a positive, non-zero number
* `percent` (optional): Show the percentage instead of `value/max` value.
* `text-inline` (optional): Keep the meter to a single line. Text and meter will be on the same line.
* `text` (optional): Context information about what the meter is about. Such as Activities.
	- `{%}` in the string will be replaced with percentage value.
	- `{x/y}` in the string will be replaced with fraction with the proper language support.
	- **DEPRECATED** `{x}` in the string will be replaced with `value`
	- **DEPRECATED** `{y}` in the string will be replaced with `max`

### Usage

Import

Then add the `d2l-meter-radial`, provide values for the properties, `value` and `max`.

```html
<d2l-meter-radial value="30" max="100"></d2l-meter-radial>
```

***Properties:***

* `value` (required): The current number of units that have been marked as completed. Should be a positive, non-zero number that is less than or equal to `max`
* `max` (required): Max number of units that is being measured by this meter. For results this should be a positive, non-zero number
* `percent` (optional): Show the percentage instead of `value/max` value.
* `text` (optional): Context information about what the meter is about. Displayed under the meter and used for screen readers.
	- `{%}` in the string will be replaced with percentage value.
	- `{x/y}` in the string will be replaced with fraction with the proper language support.

## Light Foreground

All `meter` components have a "`foreground-light`" style for displaying against a dark background. To use this style, just add this attribute:

```html
<d2l-meter-circle value="30" max="100" foreground-light></d2l-meter-circle>
```
