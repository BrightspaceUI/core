## Best Practices
<!-- docs: start best practices -->
<!-- docs: start dos -->
* Use buttons to cause an action or launch a workflow
* Keep button text short - see "Writing" guidelines
<!-- docs: end dos -->

<!-- docs: start donts -->
* Don't use multiple Primary buttons - the primary action should always be clear and obvious
* Avoid icon-only buttons with unfamiliar icons, only use these for familiar concepts
* Don't use buttons for navigation, use a link instead
* Don't open menus with buttons - use a dropdown instead
