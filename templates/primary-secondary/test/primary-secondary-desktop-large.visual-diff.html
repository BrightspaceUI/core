			<p>You need to engage students if you want to increase completion rates, graduation rates, and test scores. Engaged students are motivated to take ownership of their education, overcome hurdles, do their best, and achieve success. Here’s how Brightspace makes this happen.</p>
			<p>We make it easy to provide timely and contextual feedback and assessments. Do it through inline annotations, our assessment hub, gradebook, video and audio feedback, and amazing rubrics. Grade assignments and give feedback on the go using a mobile app. Plus, assess any type of activity, including electronic and paper submissions, and observational assessments in the class and in the field.</p>
			<p>Video isn’t just for delivering off-the-shelf content. It can make your classroom highly interactive. Within Brightspace, you can leverage video to make feedback more personalized, give students a chance to practice and build communication skills, and share videos that are fully searchable.</p>
			<p>Students of all ages get more engaged when they share their progress, reflections, and learning experiences with their classmates, teacher, and parents. Our Portfolio tool, as well as built-in badges and certificates provide instant recognition and keep students motivated. Parents love them too.</p>
			<p>K is not the same as 12. With Brightspace, your first-graders will not be using a system built for high school or college. As nonreaders and early readers, they will dive into the platform using icons and “Funster mode” to capture their experiences in their portfolio. Meanwhile, your sophomores and seniors will take advantage of more advanced features and functions. The Brightspace platform grows with each learner.</p>
			<p>It’s every teacher’s dream to reach every kid in their class – to help them achieve their full potential. We know how hard that is to achieve in your classroom – not every student starts with the same ability and knowledge, and you don’t have extra time to personalize. Our platform helps by making sure your courses are accessible, supporting universal design for learning, and making it easy to create differentiated instruction to support mastery with competency-based learning. Brightspace helps you reach them all. Organizations such as the National Federation of the Blind and the Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB) rely on us for our inclusive culture, empathetic service, and steady support.</p>
			<p>Your students won’t need the latest smartphone to get optimum results – any device with a browser will work with our apps and responsive design. Traveling athletes won’t have to miss classes or assignments, and snow days will become virtual learning days.</p>
			<p>Timely communications with parents can have a profound impact on student outcomes. Children with involved parents tend to have fewer behavioral issues, demonstrate better academic performance, and are more likely to graduate. Make it easy with Brightspace.</p>
			<p>You deal with all kinds of parents, guardians and families – some are very involved in their students’ education, while others need some encouragement. With a single click in the Brightspace platform, teachers can share a student’s work with parents, letting them know how their children are doing, what is happening in class, and what they have been working on. Notes won’t disappear in a backpack. Plus, it works on any device that parents happen to be using – making it easier to include the hardest-to-reach parents!</p>
			<p>Keep parents informed, allay their concerns, and help them prepare for and support the growth of their kids. Parents can see their child’s upcoming schedule at a glance, along with assignments, grades, announcements, events, personal reflections, and teacher comments. They can contact the teacher directly, on their own time. They can see their child’s assignment instructions, assignment submissions, completion status, course lessons, activity feed, and feedback.</p>
			<p>A growth mindset is embedded in how we designed Brightspace for Parents. When they are more informed, families can engage in more meaningful conversations using the language of growth and discovery. Instead of asking their children, “What happened at school today?” they can ask questions like, “Do you need help preparing for the math test tomorrow?” and “Can I read over your essay on Hamlet?”</p>
