### Usage
```html
<script type="module">
  import '@brightspace-ui/core/templates/primary-secondary/primary-secondary.js';
</script>

<d2l-template-primary-secondary>
    <div slot="header">Header</div>
    <div slot="primary">The primary slot</div>
    <div slot="secondary">The secondary slot</div>
    <div slot="footer">Footer</div>
</d2l-template-primary-secondary>
```

If no nodes are assigned to the `footer` slot, the footer is hidden.

**Note:** this template automatically includes `<header>`, `<main>`, `<aside>` and `<footer>` elements, so there's no need to include them inside the various slots.

### Width ###
The template accepts a `width-type` attribute. When set to `normal`, the width of the template is constrained to `1230px`.

```<d2l-template-primary-secondary width-type="normal"></d2l-template-primary-secondary>```

## Future Enhancements

- Optional draggable divider between the primary and secondary panels
- For smaller devices, the primary and secondary panels will move into collapsible drawers
