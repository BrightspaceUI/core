## Developing

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Run `npm run build` once, or any time icon or Sass files are changed.

### Running the demos

Start a [@web/dev-server](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/) that hosts the demo pages:

```shell
npm start
```

D2L employees can also view the latest main-branch demos at https://live.d2l.dev/BrightspaceUI/core/.

### Linting

```shell
# eslint and stylelint
npm run lint

# eslint only
npm run lint:eslint

# stylelint only
npm run lint:style
```

### Testing

To run the full suite of tests:

```shell
npm test
```

Alternatively, tests can be selectively run:

```shell
# unit tests
npm run test:unit

# aXe accessibility tests
npm run test:axe

# translations tests
npm run test:translations
```

Note: The axe tests require `prefers-reduced-motion` emulation to be turned on in the dev console if debugging in a local browser.

This repo uses [@brightspace-ui/testing](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/testing)'s vdiff command to perform visual regression testing:

```shell
# vdiff
npm run test:vdiff

# re-generate goldens
npm run test:vdiff -- --golden
```

### Versioning and Releasing

This repo is configured to use `semantic-release`. Commits prefixed with `fix:` and `feat:` will trigger patch and minor releases when merged to `main`.

To learn how to create major releases and release from maintenance branches, refer to the [semantic-release GitHub Action](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/actions/tree/main/semantic-release) documentation.
