## Developing

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Run `npm run build` once, or any time icon or Sass files are changed.

### Running the demos

Start a [@web/dev-server](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/) that hosts the demo pages:

```shell
npm start
```

D2L employees can also view the latest main-branch demos at https://brightspace-ui-core.d2l.dev/.

### Linting

```shell
# eslint and stylelint
npm run lint

# eslint only
npm run lint:eslint

# styleleint only
npm run lint:style
```

### Testing

```shell
# lint, unit tests and axe tests
npm test

# unit tests
npm run test:headless

# debug or run a subset of local unit tests
npm run test:headless:watch
```

Note: The axe tests require `prefers-reduced-motion` emulation to be turned on in the dev console if debugging in a local browser.

### Visual Diff Testing

This repo uses the [@brightspace-ui/visual-diff utility](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/visual-diff/) to compare current snapshots against a set of golden snapshots stored in source control.

The golden snapshots in source control must be updated by the [visual-diff GitHub Action](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/actions/tree/main/visual-diff).  If a pull request results in visual differences, a draft pull request with the new goldens will automatically be opened against its branch.

To run the tests locally to help troubleshoot or develop new tests, first install these dependencies:

```shell
npm install @brightspace-ui/visual-diff@X  --no-save
```

Replace `X` with [the current version](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/actions/tree/main/visual-diff#current-dependency-versions) the action is using.

Then run the tests:

```shell
# run visual-diff tests
npx mocha './**/*.visual-diff.js' -t 10000
# subset of visual-diff tests:
npx mocha './**/*.visual-diff.js' -t 10000 -g some-pattern
# update visual-diff goldens
npx mocha './**/*.visual-diff.js' -t 10000 --golden
```

## Versioning & Releasing

> TL;DR: Commits prefixed with `fix:` and `feat:` will trigger patch and minor releases when merged to `main`. Read on for more details...

The [semantic-release GitHub Action](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/actions/tree/main/semantic-release) is called from the `release.yml` GitHub Action workflow to handle version changes and releasing.

### Version Changes

All version changes should obey [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) rules:
1. **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. **PATCH** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

The next version number will be determined from the commit messages since the previous release. Our semantic-release configuration uses the [Angular convention](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-angular) when analyzing commits:
* Commits which are prefixed with `fix:` or `perf:` will trigger a `patch` release. Example: `fix: validate input before using`
* Commits which are prefixed with `feat:` will trigger a `minor` release. Example: `feat: add toggle() method`
* To trigger a MAJOR release, include `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines in the footer of the commit message
* Other suggested prefixes which will **NOT** trigger a release: `build:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:` and `test:`. Example: `docs: adding README for new component`

To revert a change, add the `revert:` prefix to the original commit message. This will cause the reverted change to be omitted from the release notes. Example: `revert: fix: validate input before using`.

### Releases

When a release is triggered, it will:
* Update the version in `package.json`
* Tag the commit
* Create a GitHub release (including release notes)
* Deploy a new package to NPM

### Releasing from Maintenance Branches

Occasionally you'll want to backport a feature or bug fix to an older release. `semantic-release` refers to these as [maintenance branches](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/workflow-configuration#maintenance-branches).

Maintenance branch names should be of the form: `+([0-9])?(.{+([0-9]),x}).x`.

Regular expressions are complicated, but this essentially means branch names should look like:
* `1.15.x` for patch releases on top of the `1.15` release (after version `1.16` exists)
* `2.x` for feature releases on top of the `2` release (after version `3` exists)
